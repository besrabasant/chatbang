# Chatbang .env sample
# Copy this file to `.env` and customize as needed.
# Chatbang loads `.env` automatically if present.

# Logging level for structured logs: one of trace, debug, info, warn, error.
# If LOG_LEVEL is unset and DEBUG=true, debug level is used.
# LOG_LEVEL=info

# Quick toggle for debug logging (overrides default to debug level when true).
# Accepts: true/false or 1/0
# DEBUG=true

# Optional: write logs to a file in addition to stderr.
# `~` is expanded to your home directory; parent directories are created.
# LOG_FILE=~/.config/chatbang/chatbang.log
